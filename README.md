## Code Description

This code is an automated trading software that executes buy/sell orders based on customizable parameters. It also supports multiple activations on a single subscription. The code includes functions for customizing trading parameters, optimizing performance, handling errors and exceptions, integrating with a trading platform, providing documentation, testing and debugging, and providing ongoing support and maintenance.

### Import necessary libraries

This code imports the following libraries:
- Trade.mqh: Library for trading operations
- ArrayDouble.mqh: Library for handling arrays of double values

### Define constants

The code defines the following constants:
- MAX_ACTIVATIONS: Maximum number of activations allowed
- MAX_8G_BOTS: Maximum number of 8G bots allowed
- MAX_4G_BOTS: Maximum number of 4G bots allowed

### Define trade parameters

The code allows customization of the following trade parameters through user input:
- riskLevel: Risk level for buy/sell orders
- algorithm: Algorithm for trading
- enableTradingHours: Flag to enable trading hours
- enableTradingDays: Flag to enable trading days
- indicatorPeriod: Period for indicators
- timeframe: Timeframe for trading

### Initialize trade objects

The code initializes a trade object (CTrade) and an array of double values (CArrayDouble) for activations.

### Execute Orders

The function `ExecuteOrders()` handles buy/sell orders based on the customizable parameters. It retrieves the current price and checks if buy/sell orders are allowed. It then calculates the lot size based on the risk level and places the corresponding buy/sell order.

### Activate Bots

The function `ActivateBots()` handles multiple activations on a single subscription. It checks if the maximum number of activations has been reached. If not, it adds the activation to the list and checks if 8G bots and 4G bots are allowed. Depending on the allowed bots, it runs the corresponding logic.

### Customize Parameters

The function `CustomizeParameters()` allows customization of trading parameters. It provides a placeholder to customize the algorithm, trading hours, trading days, indicator period, and timeframe.

### Optimize Performance

The function `OptimizePerformance()` provides a placeholder to optimize performance using efficient algorithms and data structures.

### Handle Errors

The function `HandleErrors()` provides a placeholder to implement error handling and exception management.

### Integrate with Platform

### Provide Documentation

The function `ProvideDocumentation()` provides a placeholder to write clear and concise documentation explaining the code logic, functions, and usage.

### Test and Debug

The function `TestAndDebug()` provides a placeholder to perform thorough testing and debugging of the code.

### Provide Support and Maintenance

The function `ProvideSupportAndMaintenance()` provides a placeholder to continuously address future updates or modifications to the software.

### Entry Point
